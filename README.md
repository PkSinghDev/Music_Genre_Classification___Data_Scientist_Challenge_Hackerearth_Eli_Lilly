# Music_Genre_Classification 
## Data Scientist Challenge at Hackerearth for Eli Lilly and Company

#### Problem Statement: -
Eli Lilly and Company posted a Data Scientist Challenge at Hackerearth. The machine learning question from the challenge is given below: - <br>
A music genre is a conventional category that identifies some pieces of music as belonging to a shared tradition or set of conventions. **The major task at hand is to find what music genre a song belongs to??**

#### Train Data: -
This csv file consists of 15681 instances, each having 18 features. The features list with description is as follows: -<br>
**instance_id**      - Unique ID for a song in the dataset.<br>
**track_name**       - Song Name.<br>
**popularity**       - It depends on the total no of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.<br>
**acousticness**     - A measure whether the music is acoustic. A score of 1.0 means the song is most likely to be an acoustic one.<br>
**danceability**     - How suitable this song is for dancing.<br>
**duration_ms**      - Length of the music song.<br>
**energy**           - Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.<br>
**instrumentalness** - This value represents the amount of vocals in the song. The closer it is to 1.0, the more instrumental the song is.<br>
**key**              - Gives the key in which this song was composed.<br>
**liveness**         - Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.<br>

**mode**             - A mode is the vocabulary of a melody.<br>
**speechiness**      - Detects the presence of spoken words in a track.<br>
**tempo**            - The speed at which a song is recorded and performed. (beats per minute)<br>
**musician_category**- Artist Category whether duet, solo or band.<br>
**valence**          - Describes the musical positiveness conveyed by a track.<br>
**music_genre**      - Genre of the music song.<br>


#### Test Data: -
This csv file consists of 3921 instances, each having 17 features. The target attribute "music_genre" is missing from this data which needs to be predicted based on features available.
